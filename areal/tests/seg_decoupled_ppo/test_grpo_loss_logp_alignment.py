"""Unit tests to verify correct logprob alignment in grpo_loss_fn.

This test guards against the bug where old_logp was incorrectly double-rolled.

Background:
- old_logp is already rolled in compute_logp() at line 93:
  `old_logp = torch.roll(data["logprobs"], shifts=-1, dims=-1)`
- It should NOT be rolled again in grpo_loss_fn()
- prox_logp is also already rolled in compute_logp()
- proximal_logprobs_t needs to be rolled in grpo_loss_fn() because it comes
  from inference backend without rolling

This test simulates the grpo_loss_fn behavior to verify alignment without
importing the actual function (to avoid import dependencies).
