"""Capacity modifier that compensates for filtered samples.

This module provides a CapacityModifier implementation that tracks samples
filtered by staleness control and adjusts capacity accordingly to prevent
deadlock in segment-wise PPO training.

class FilteredSamplesCapacityModifier(CapacityModifier):
    """Compensates capacity for samples filtered by staleness control.

    Problem:
    When samples are filtered out (e.g., by SegmentWisePPOStrategy), they are
    counted in StalenessManager's `accepted` count but aren't actually available
    for training. This causes get_capacity() to become too restrictive, potentially
    leading to deadlock where no new rollouts can be generated.

    Solution:
    This modifier tracks the number of filtered samples and adds that count back
    to the capacity calculation, ensuring that filtered samples don't block new
    rollout generation.

    Thread Safety:
    All methods are thread-safe and can be called from multiple threads.

    Example:
        >>> modifier = FilteredSamplesCapacityModifier()
        >>> staleness_manager.register_capacity_modifier(modifier)
        >>> # When samples are filtered:
        >>> modifier.on_samples_filtered(5)
        >>> # Capacity will be increased by 5 to compensate
