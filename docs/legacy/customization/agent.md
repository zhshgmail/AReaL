# Rollout and Agentic RL (Legacy)

> **Note**: While this legacy approach works, we strongly recommend using AReaL-lite for
> new projects. It provides better flexibility, cleaner abstractions, and easier
> maintenance.

## Step 1: Define Your Agent Class

Create a new file under `realhf/impl/agent/`, such as `math_multi_turn_agent.py`. Your
`Agent` must implement the interface defined in `realhf/api/core/agent.py`, which
requires a single method: `collect_trajectory`.

```python
class MathMultiTurnAgent(Agent):
    async def collect_trajectory(
        self,
        prompt: SequenceSample,
        env: EnvironmentService,
        obs_queue: asyncio.Queue,
        act_queue: asyncio.Queue,
    ):
        # Implementation goes here
        ...
```

## Step 2: Implement the Trajectory Collection Logic

The `collect_trajectory` method takes a task prompt, an environment, and two
communication queues. Within this method, you control the data flow between your agent
and the inference engine using these queues:

- **obs_queue**: Send observations (token IDs and generation config) to the inference
  engine
- **act_queue**: Receive actions (generated responses) from the inference engine

Here's how the multi-turn conversation works:

```python
for turn in range(self.num_turns):
    # Send the current state to the inference engine
    await obs_queue.put((qid, token_ids, self.gconfig))

    # Get the generated response
    act: BundledGenerationOutputs = await act_queue.get()

    # Evaluate the response through the environment
    success, rewards = await env.step((qid, answers))
    # ... process results ...
```

### Environment Integration

The environment follows a
[Gym-like interface](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) with `reset` and
`step` methods, but uses asynchronous implementations to prevent blocking across
different environment instances.

For math problems, the environment is typically stateless and acts as a wrapper around
your reward function:

```python
class MathCodeSingleStepEnv(EnvironmentService):
    async def step(self, action: Tuple[str, List[str]]):
        qid, answers = action
        # ... setup code ...

        # Run reward computation asynchronously
        format_rewards = await asyncio.to_thread(
            math_verify_call,
            answers,
            # ... other parameters ...
        )
        return None, format_rewards, True, False, {}
```

### Handling Multi-Turn Feedback

After receiving the reward from `env.step`, check if the answer is correct. If not,
provide feedback and continue to the next turn:

```python
for turn in range(self.num_turns):
    # ... generation and evaluation code ...

    # Provide feedback based on the result
    if success[0]:
        feedback = "Congratulations! You are correct!"
    else:
        feedback = "Unfortunately your answer is wrong. Let's try again."

    # Format feedback as a user message
    feedback = "\n" + self.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
        [{"content": feedback, "role": "user"}],
        add_generation_prompt=True,
        tokenize=False,
    )

    # Add feedback tokens to the conversation
    feedback_tokens = self.tokenizer(feedback)["input_ids"]
    token_ids.extend(feedback_tokens)
```

## Step 3: Register and Configure Your Agent

First, register your agent implementation:

```python
# in realhf/impl/agent/math_multi_turn_agent.py
register_agent("math-multi-turn", MathMultiTurnAgent)
```

```python
# in realhf/impl/agent/__init__.py
import realhf.impl.agent.math_multi_turn_agent
```

Then update your experiment configuration in
`realhf/experiments/async_exp/async_math_ppo.py`:

```python
@dataclasses.dataclass
class AsyncPPOMATHConfig(AsyncRLExperimentConfig, PPOMATHConfig):
    # Add any new CLI arguments your agent needs
    my_param: float = 1.0

    @property
    def agent(self) -> AgentAbstraction:
        return AgentAbstraction(
            "math-multi-turn",  # Your registered agent name
            args=dict(
                # Pass any arguments needed for your __init__ method
                my_param=self.my_param,
                # ... other configuration ...
            ),
        )

    @property
    def env(self) -> EnvServiceAbstraction:
        # Update to use your custom environment if needed
        return EnvServiceAbstraction(
            "math-code-single-step",
            args=dict(dataset_path=self.dataset.path)
        )
```

## Step 4: Run Training

Follow the standard training procedure outlined in the
[quickstart guide](../../tutorial/quickstart_legacy.md). Launch your experiment with:

```bash
python3 realhf/training/main_async_ppo.py my_param=5.0  # plus any additional CLI arguments
```

## Training Results

Here's an example of the training reward curve from our multi-turn math agent:

![Multi-turn Training Rewards](multiturn_reward.png)

The agent successfully learns to solve math problems with improved accuracy over time,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the multi-turn approach.
